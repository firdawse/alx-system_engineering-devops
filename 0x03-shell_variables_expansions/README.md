This task requires you to create a shell script that will create an alias. In this specific case, you need to create an alias named "ls" that will execute the command "rm *". This means that whenever you type "ls" in your terminal, it will execute the command "rm *".

After creating the script, you need to run the "source" command to execute the script in the current shell environment. This will allow you to use the newly created alias "ls" in your current terminal session.

The given example shows the use of the script where it deletes all files in the current directory when the user types "ls". The backslash before "ls" is used to bypass the alias temporarily and execute the original "ls" command.
